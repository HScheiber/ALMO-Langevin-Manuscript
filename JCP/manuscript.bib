abstract = {An effective method with large convergence tolerance for self-consistent-field calculations is proposed to accelerate Born-Oppenheimer molecular-dynamics simulations based on the density functional theory. The errors for forces with large convergence tolerance are taken as the noises of Langevin dynamics for constant-temperature molecular dynamics. We use different systems such as crystalline Si, liquid Si and liquid water to verify the accuracy and efficiency of the method. Results of the new method are consistent with those of sufficiently accurate methods and the dynamical properties of the systems are reproduced as well. The efficiency of computation is improved by a factor of two to three using this model. Our analysis provides three reasons which explain why the method works. This development effectively extends the application of Born-Oppenheimer molecular dynamics to larger systems.},

abstract = {Nanocrystalline light metal hydrides are interesting for hydrogen storage in zero-emission vehicles. In this paper, recent detailed results on the sorption behaviour of nanocrystalline Mg and Mg-based alloys are presented. Different transition metals have been added to Mg to achieve a thermodynamic destabilisation of the hydride, thus lowering the desorption temperatures to about 230 degreesC. A breakthrough in sorption kinetics was achieved by using nanocrystalline materials produced by high-energy milling. Additionally, new catalysts based on metal oxides have been added to further enhance the sorption reaction. As a result, hydrogen is absorbed and released within minutes instead of hours as in conventional Mg hydrides. The new materials fulfill the current requirements for the desired application with respect to both, capacity and kinetics.},

Its origi lies in the Einstein relation for the diffusion constant and the mobility of a Brownian particle. The short history of the fluctuation-dissipation theorem is described. Then the linear response theory is brifly summarized and the meaning of stochastization is considered. The Langevin equation approach and its extensions are reviewed.},

abstract = {Inelastic neutron scattering spectroscopy has been used to observe and characterise hydrogen on the carbon component of a Pt/C catalyst. INS provides the complete vibration spectrum of coronene, regarded as a molecular model of a graphite layer. The vibrational modes are assigned with the aid of ab initio density functional theory calculations and the INS spectra by the a-CLIMAX program. A spectrum for which the H modes of coronene have been computationally suppressed, a carbon-only coronene spectrum, is a better representation of the spectrum of a graphite layer than is coronene itself. Dihydrogen dosing of a Pt/C catalyst caused amplification of the surface modes of carbon, an effect described as H riding on carbon. From the enhancement of the low energy carbon modes (100-600 cm(-1)) it is concluded that spillover hydrogen becomes attached to dangling bonds at the edges of graphitic regions of the carbon support.

abstract = {Density functional theory calculations are computationally extremely expensive for systems containing many atoms due to their intrinsic cubic scaling. This fact has led to the development of so-called linear scaling algorithms during the last few decades. In this way it becomes possible to perform ab initio calculations for several tens of thousands of atoms within reasonable walltimes. However{\{},{\}} even though the use of linear scaling algorithms is physically well justified{\{},{\}} their implementation often introduces some small errors. Consequently most implementations offering such a linear complexity either yield only a limited accuracy or{\{},{\}} if one wants to go beyond this restriction{\{},{\}} require a tedious fine tuning of many parameters. In our linear scaling approach within the BigDFT package{\{},{\}} we were able to overcome this restriction. Using an ansatz based on localized support functions expressed in an underlying Daubechies wavelet basis - which offers ideal properties for accurate linear scaling calculations - we obtain an amazingly high accuracy and a universal applicability while still keeping the possibility of simulating large system with linear scaling walltimes requiring only a moderate demand of computing resources. We prove the effectiveness of our method on a wide variety of systems with different boundary conditions{\{},{\}} for single-point calculations as well as for geometry optimizations and molecular dynamics.},

@inproceedings{a:prezhdorev,
abstract = {The chromophore-semiconductor interface offers a classic example of an interaction between an organic molecular species and an inorganic bulk material. The interface provides the foundation for a new, promising type of solar cell and presents a fundamentally important case study for several fields, including photo-, electro- and analytical chemistries, molecular electronics, and photography. Scientists employ different concepts and terminologies to describe molecular and solid states of matter, and these differences make it difficult to describe the interface with a single model. At the basic atomistic level of description, however, this challenge can be largely overcome. Recent advances in non-adiabatic molecular dynamics and time-domain density functional theory have created a unique opportunity for simulating the ultrafast, photoinduced processes on a computer very similar to the way that they occur in nature. The progress report is a review of these state-of-the-art theoretical tools. It offers a comprehensive picture of a variety of electron transfer processes that occur at the interface. The topics of discussion include electron injection from the chromophore to the semiconductor, electron relaxation and delocalization inside the semiconductor, back-transfer of the electron to the chromophore and to the electrolyte, and regeneration of the neutral chromophore by the electrolyte. The ab initio time-domain modeling is particularly valuable for understanding these dynamic features of the ultrafast electron transfer processes, which cannot be represented by a simple rate description. For example, the simulations show that what appears as a single step, such as electron injection, is in fact an average over many distinct elementary processes, and that very different vibrational modes drive electron transfer, depending on the process, the system, and the experimental conditions. The report focuses in particular on the electronic donor-acceptor interaction, atomic motions, electron-vibrational coupling, surface termination, thermal effects, electron transfer mechanisms and fluctuations from the average behavior.

abstract = {Born-Oppenheimer molecular dynamics simulations with long-term conservation of the total energy and a computational cost that scales linearly with system size have been obtained simultaneously. Linear scaling with a low pre-factor is achieved using density matrix purification with sparse matrix algebra and a numerical threshold on matrix elements. The extended Lagrangian Born-Oppenheimer molecular dynamics formalism [A. M. N. Niklasson, Phys. Rev. Lett. 100, 123004 (2008)] yields microcanonical trajectories with the approximate forces obtained from the linear scaling method that exhibit no systematic drift over hundreds of picoseconds and which are indistinguishable from trajectories computed using exact forces.},
